## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

This is a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance and AWD.

Summary of Linear regression model:

- Vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
- The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-value of the linear model was much smaller than the significance level, which shows that the null hypothesis is not true.
- R-squared is .7149, which is a strong correlation for the dataset and shows the dataset is 71% accurate.
